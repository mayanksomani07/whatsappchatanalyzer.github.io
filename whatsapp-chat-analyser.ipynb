Please note that OFFLINE LAB SESSIONS ARE ALSO COMPLETED FOR HIGHER SEMESTERS IN DEC 2021 ITSELF;\n",

      "As you all know, India is full of diversity and culture. There's a lot to learn from its unique cultural roots. But the Indian education system comes to barren texts when spoken about giving exposure and practical education. Students do excel in textual knowledge but have nullified experience over how actual the world can be. \n",
      "There is a world outside the classroom which teaches us a lot of life lessons and skills. Those lessons and skills can be acquired only by stepping outside of the classroom and gaining real-world experience. We proffer this idea by organizing planned and detailed educational tours for students where they can understand the purpose of their learning and visualize their education in the true context in which it is meant to be used. This will help them develop and nurture in a better environment on the whole.\n",

Yesterday more than 1000 cases came in Karnataka with 810 in Bangalore itself. The results of most of the hostelites for the COVID RT-PCR test are still not out so it can't be ascertained that they are all negative hence, unsafe. Our parents back home are equally tensed while a few of our classmates are also showing symptoms.\\n\\nIn light of the recent spurt of COVID cases in our city, we are apprehensive of attending the CIEs that have been scheduled from tomorrow - Monday, the 3rd of January, 2022. Additionally, day scholars live who live with their families are exposing older people and more importantly younger un-vaccinated children below the age of 16. Therefore, we request you to kindly conduct the CIE online or postpone the same to allow us to attend it positively.\\n\\nPlease find attached, the list of students from ISE who are requesting for postponement of/online CIE 2.\\n\\nSincerely\\n5th Sem students\\n1/2/22, 6:46 PM - +91 88614 47658: Prod ofp sheniurs\\n1/2/22, 6:46 PM - +91 87625 73800: Yes cs seniors already done it\\n1/2/22, 6:46 PM - +91 87927 74664: Dude ...

Certificate of excellence on completion of internship.\\n\\nAbout us:\\nAs you all know, India is full of diversity and culture. There's a lot to learn from its unique cultural roots. But the Indian education system comes to barren texts when spoken about giving exposure and practical education. Students do excel in textual knowledge but have nullified experience over how actual the world can be. \\nThere is a world outside the classroom which teaches us a lot of life lessons and skills. Those lessons and skills can be acquired only by stepping outside of the classroom and gaining real-world experience. We proffer this idea by organizing planned and detailed educational tours for students where they can understand the purpose of their learning and visualize their education in the true context in which it is meant to be used. This will help them develop and nurture in a better environment on the whole.\\n\\nFor any queries too, you can mail us at ingeniousinside@gmail.com\\nBest Wishes\\nIngenious Inside Ed-Tours\\n\",\n",
