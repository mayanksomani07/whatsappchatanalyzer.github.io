12/13/21, 5:51 PM - +91 81971 41648: I spoke to Shwetha ma'am regarding it ...she agreed under the condition this sld be kept within d class...
The 10th expm is definitely cancelled. She asked us to collectively choose one more program for deletion. 
So.. vote for which program u want removed
On basis of majority I ll inform Shwetha ma'am d same
12/13/21, 5:53 PM - +91 87927 74664: I feel taht polynomial multiplication is a little long ...

1/2/22, 6:46 PM - +91 88614 47658: Respected Sir

This is to inform you that amid the COVID rise in our city and more importantly COVID cases in college has made the scenario of coming to college unsafe. Yesterday more than 1000 cases came in Karnataka with 810 in Bangalore itself. The results of most of the hostelites for the COVID RT-PCR test are still not out so it can't be ascertained that they are all negative hence, unsafe. Our parents back home are equally tensed while a few of our classmates are also showing symptoms.

In light of the recent spurt of COVID cases in our city, we are apprehensive of attending the CIEs that have been scheduled from tomorrow - Monday, the 3rd of January, 2022. Additionally, day scholars live who live with their families are exposing older people and more importantly younger un-vaccinated children below the age of 16. Therefore, we request you to kindly conduct the CIE online or postpone the same to allow us to attend it positively.

Please find attached, the list of students from ISE who are requesting for postponement of/online CIE 2.

Sincerely
5th Sem students

1/2/22, 7:00 PM - +91 81979 45985: Dear Shrikrishna
Good morning

5 cases were reported...now, Absolutely nothing to worry.....things are completely under control. All students of hostel have been subjected to RTPCR test and found negative. 
If you still feel it is not safe, we will consider the retest for you. 

Anytime before 31 January you can come and write the offline test. 

31st January is the last working day of our  semester.  our academic calendar is very tight. 
But question of giving online test is ruled out as many students lack basic facilities.
1/2/22, 7:00 PM - +91 81979 45985: Dean sent this to a 7th sem student
1/2/22, 7:01 PM - +91 81979 45985: 5 cases reported? I thought I was 27 wtf 😂

Am planning to talk to sagar sir to continue the online classes till cie 3. Since syllabus is almost complete in all subjects and the labs are completed for the semester, it is only risky we go for offline classes. It's better to self quarantine and prepare for cie 3 and SEE.  So please fill the Google form actively so we can let the hod know of our opinion

1/25/22, 11:25 AM - +91 81971 41648: Dear Professor

We have received many emails from students and parents regarding the conduction of Offline Classes for III Sem B.E Students.
We wish to clarify the following:
As per our earlier Calendar of Events, the III sem B.E Programs, 31st Jan 2022 - the last working day (which is common to III, V & VII sem B.E Programs); However, students have confirmed that in most of the departments, the syllabus / portions in all the courses have been completed.
Any department who have completed the syllabus 100%, students need not attend the OFFLINE CLASSES starting from 2nd Feb 2022;
If the syllabus is pending (around 10-15%) you may take ONLINE CLASSES FOR ONE WEEK AND COMPLETE THE SAME; Because of 1 or 2 pending courses students need not come to premises for offline sessions. Please note that OFFLINE LAB SESSIONS ARE ALSO COMPLETED FOR HIGHER SEMESTERS IN DEC 2021 ITSELF;
HoDs are requested to take a final call after obtaining the status of syllabus coverage with their respective faculty handling the III sem Courses and inform the students accordingly (ONLINE / OFFLINE);
However, it is mandatory for all the DIPLOMA STUDENTS to attend the OFFLINE THEORY AND LAB SESSIONS;
Regular students will join the diploma students while writing Offline CIE-III commencing from March 14-16, 2022;
For any additional information and clarifications please write back to us.
1/25/22, 11:25 AM - +91 81971 41648: Frm dean...

About us:
As you all know, India is full of diversity and culture. There's a lot to learn from its unique cultural roots. But the Indian education system comes to barren texts when spoken about giving exposure and practical education. Students do excel in textual knowledge but have nullified experience over how actual the world can be. 
There is a world outside the classroom which teaches us a lot of life lessons and skills. Those lessons and skills can be acquired only by stepping outside of the classroom and gaining real-world experience. We proffer this idea by organizing planned and detailed educational tours for students where they can understand the purpose of their learning and visualize their education in the true context in which it is meant to be used. This will help them develop and nurture in a better environment on the whole.

For any queries too, you can mail us at ingeniousinside@gmail.com
Best Wishes
Ingenious Inside Ed-Tours

5/1/22, 10:36 AM - +91 94725 82996: Hello sir/ma'am,


This is Ayush Shankar of ME-3A (1RV20ME029), sir as per our schedule for the Sem End Examination we were having our last paper (kannada) on 2nd of May which was decided a month ago.


We have our flight booking for the 3rd of May and this date change is affecting us a lot both mentally and financially. 

First, of all if the Ramzan dates were prior known to the management why were the dates made to coincide with the exam, if the management knew they will have to change it later. 

We do not expect college to give reimbursement to everyone, the only solution which will give justice is either management take the exam tomorrow or take in online mode on the 6th of May.

These kind of steps taken by the management is distasteful. We expect you to consider our solution.


Looking forward to hearing from you soon.


Regards

Ayush Shankar

5/3/22, 3:02 PM - +91 87927 74664: This is sheer disappointment to we faculty members to house such students who don’t understand the situation
5/3/22, 3:02 PM - +91 87927 74664: And many a times I warned also, don’t book the tickets immediately. Didn’t I tell?
5/3/22, 3:02 PM - +91 87927 74664: Such a shame that we are housing a group of students those who don’t have basic etiquette to understand the situation. 

1. How can you make a general statement about management and college under such situations. 

2. You have been seeing such situations from the day you have joined. That is during Covid times. At that time also situations were very uncertain and no body knew how the situation would be. 

However govt and university was directing us to do, we were following the same protocol. 

For such things how can you blame college. 

When we announced open book exam, exam cancellation and all at that time no voice because everything was in your favour. 

Now that govt and university and some moon committee has decided about Ramzan and how can college take decision on that. 

Don’t you have this little common sense to judge and know the situation before putting blame?
5/3/22, 3:02 PM - +91 87927 74664: This is not our problem, understand the situation and act

At SIGHT, we partner with local communities and leverage technology to tackle key problems. We are kick-starting this year's activities and are excited for your participation in them. *SJP* is a government diploma college, with bright students who are deprived of many facilities. As they take up additional courses in higher semesters, it's necessary that they know what each subject has to offer. Hence, SIGHT gives you an opportunity to give them this exposure! 

*Location:* SJP government diploma college 
*Day & Date:* Saturdays i.e, 
*18-06-22* or *02-07-22*
*Hours to be spent:* 2hrs (on each topic) 
*To be covered:* What opportunities the subject opens students up to and what career options it provides
*Team size:* 2 
*Eligibility*: IEEE SIGHT membership (If you are only an IEEE member, you can become a SIGHT member for free! Ping us for that)
Members who are interested can fill out the form with *one topic* of their choice. Activity points will be provided.
https://forms.gle/Kd3ryYRWRZE6Hsks9 

Further details will be intimated.
Thank you!

6/20/22, 9:04 PM - 7: *We know most of you already had the word in mind, out of curiosity though what did you think when it first struck you?*

*Often times when we come across the word shifting paradigms we tend to think of something big, it almost feels like one of those 'my whole life is a lie' moments, for instance when we discovered that the Earth isn't flat.*

*You could even think of shifting paradigms as a Eureka moment when Newton explained gravity and Einstein introduced us to the concept of relativity.*

*Shifting paradigms was originally explained for the scientific theory but even the term had its shift as it gained popularity amongst other fields such as the paradigm shift created by Shakespeare's impact on drama and when jazz and rock revolutionised music.*

*We witnessed shifting paradigms in business with the emergence of e-commerce and Ed-tech during covid that took the market by storm.*

*And here at E-cell, we hope to be at the pinnacle of such shifting paradigms.*

It was not possible to install vs code on the lab systems due to technical issues apparently.
The following IDEs will be installed in all of the lab systems: CodeBlocks, PyCharm, IntelliJ .
All three IDEs will be available for use for the lab exam tmrw.
7/27/22, 9:22 PM - +91 81971 41648: Also, gedit will be available and u can use that also
7/27/22, 9:24 PM - +91 81971 41648: Additionally, second phase EL presentation will mostly be conducted before the third internals. Sweta ma'am asks everyone to get the entire project ready by September.

7/27/22, 11:13 PM - +91 81971 41648: However, u ll have to show detailed implementation in the final exam

With this year's Ganesh Chaturthi closing in⏳️, *Bengaluru Ganesh Utsava* is organising a *"Clay Seed Ganesha Making"* event along with KSPCB and Rotary on August 28th, 2022 at National College Ground, Basavanagudi. About 10,000 participants are expected to take part. 

For this, volunteers are needed who can help with table arrangements, helping the participants, providing clay, etc. Volunteers are needed from 8am to 5:30pm. 

NOTE -  *T-shirts, Certificates, Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks*  will be provided to all volunteers by BGU. 
Also, *3 activity points🤩* will be provided to RVCE students 

While Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated auspiciously, it has its own problems. Water pollution due to POP statues and toxic paint is one major problem which can be prevented by keeping Clay Ganesha. With this idea, let's all help BGU with the "Clay Seed Ganesha Making Event" by stepping up to volunteer and help celebrate a *pollution-free and green🌱* Ganesh Chaturthi.

8/24/22, 1:12 PM - +91 94130 23236: They are giving us 2 months holiday after 4th sem- To do internship and get activity points, 5th sem will start in Jan
We will be one sem behind but they are planning to combine 7th and 8th semester not sure how yet, either the 6 month will be 3 month college + 3 month internship or no 8th sem internship
8/24/22, 2:35 PM - +91 87927 74664: Okay since i sent this message to one person and it mass circulated and idk how 😂
Let me add some clarification 
We spoke to HOD sir for clarification
So the exact dates of our holidays will be given soon but approx Nov 18-Jan 18th 2 months to do internship and get activity points
We will get 2 months after 6th sem as well for internship
Regarding placements, they are unsure but Girish sir and HOD sir said it'll be in nov-jan will be delayed
Regarding 7th and 8th sem clarification, 8th sem will be 5 months only so no shortening we will graduate late ,around December if we're lucky instead of July August like usual so people applying for masters(unsure what the scene is) because our current super seniors who passed out took early certificate but they were only 1-2 months behind so sir said we'll see that later)
So our 5th sem will start in Jan mid and 6th sem after that, after we finish 6tg sem which will be shortened by a bit placements will start after 6th sem or end of 6th sem
That's the news we know from now( all are hypothetical depends on whether RV can be efficient next year)
8/24/22, 3:56 PM - Amish (ISE): Summary : we will graduate in 2025
Thanks RV
8/24/22, 3:58 PM - Amish (ISE): Me enjoying at RV with 69 others

4.	Emerging trends in ----------
5.	Case studies (5 stages of DTL)

Suppose if the domain/cluster is Water conservation the above points will be viz.,
1.	Perspectives and building blocks: The perspective may be water availability, usage, distribution of water, per capita usage, etc
2.	Technology and systems: available water conservation technologies (literature survey) across the globe and related information
3.	 Optimizing the above sighted technologies: here the research gaps (Think global, act local approach)
4.	Emerging trends in the conservation of water
5.	All 5 phases of DTL
Sl. No. 1-4 will be common to all the students in a domain, distribute the work accordingly.
Sl. No. 5 is the individual DT work carried out, report it as a case study using all 5 stages of DTL.
Please show the report to Princy sir and finalize it.
The last date of the final report should be 29.09.2022.

Students in lab batches 2 and 3 please note that today is the last day for the submission of the schema diagram. Changes must be made and evaluated today itself by the lab in-charge. 
If this is not done, 50% of the marks will be reduced.
